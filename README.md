anim8 spritebatch demo
======================

This is a demo of anim8's animations interacting with spritebatches using the new `getFrameInfo` animation method.

It also shows how the shearing factor is handled correctly when drawing animations which have been flipped vertically and/or horizontally.

In order to run it, you will need LÃ–VE >= 0.9.

While the demo runs, use the arrow keys to change the shearing factor (displayed in the top-left).
